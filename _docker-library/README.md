# _docker-library

This directory is a placeholder with samples for the following repos:

- https://github.com/docker-library/docs
- https://github.com/docker-library/official-images

When we are ready to submit a pull request for landing an official image repo
for Dart, those are where we'll submit them in reference to this repo. This
directory should be deleted before then.
